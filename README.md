# Dark Synthwave '84 - VSC theme

Theme based on [Synthwave Robb 0wen theme](https://github.com/robb0wen/synthwave-vscode)

# Description
But with no glowing effect - just a simple theme for work.
You can find native syntax highlighting for top-most known languages such as
Java, Python, Dart, C#, Kotlin, Swift, TypeScript, C++, Go and other.

## Original theme

Original theme according to Robb 0wen is influenced by the music and the cover artwork of modern Synthwave bands like FM-84, Timecop 1983 and The Midnight. By association, that means I've also taken heavy influence from the excellent [retro-tinged artwork of James White](https://signalnoise.com/) (check out his work, it's awesome).

## Contributing
It's for the original theme: before you make any changes, [please read the contribution guide](https://github.com/robb0wen/synthwave-vscode/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Thanks from Robb
Lastly, I couldn't have made this if it weren't for the fantastic work of [Sarah Drasner](https://twitter.com/sarah_edo). Her [tutorial on theming for CSS tricks](https://css-tricks.com/creating-a-vs-code-theme/) was a huge help in developing this üôè

Similarly, I'd like to thanks [Wes Bos](https://twitter.com/wesbos) for his [cool Cobalt2 theme](https://github.com/wesbos/cobalt2-vscode). His readme helped me figure out how to package this hot mess for public use üëç

If this theme is too much, then I recommend [Horizon](https://github.com/jolaleye/horizon-theme-vscode), or [City Lights](http://citylights.xyz/) for a similar, yet more understated, retro vibe. They're both beautiful.

## Thanks from Me
Thank you [Robb](https://github.com/robb0wen)
